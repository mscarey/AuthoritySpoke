In particular, we must decide whether, as the district court held, plaintiff-appellee Lotus Development Corporation\u2019s copyright in Lotus 1-2-3, a computer spreadsheet program, was infringed by defendant-appellant Borland International, Inc., when Borland copied the Lotus 1-2-3 menu command hierarchy into its Quattro and Quattro Pro computer spreadsheet programs. See Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int\u2019l, Inc., 788 F.Supp. 78 (D.Mass.1992) (\u201cBorland I\u201d); Lotus Dev. Corp. v.

Corp. v. Borland Int\u2019l, Inc., 831 F.Supp. 223 (D.Mass.1993) (\u201cBorland IV\u201d).\nI.\nBackground\nLotus 1-2-3 is a spreadsheet program that enables users to perform accounting functions electronically on a computer. Users manipulate and control the program via a series of menu commands, such as \u201cCopy,\u201d \u201cPrint,\u201d and \u201cQuit.\u201d Users choose commands either by highlighting them on the screen or by typing their first letter. In all, Lotus 1-2-3 has 469 commands arranged into more than 50 menus and submenus.\nLotus 1-2-3, like many computer programs, allows users to write what are called \u201cmacros.\u201d By writing a macro, a user can designate a series of command choices with a single macro keystroke. Then, to execute that series of commands in multiple parts of the spreadsheet, rather than typing the whole series each time, the user only needs to type the single pre-programmed macro keystroke, causing the program to recall and perform the designated series of commands automatically. Thus, Lotus 1-2-3 macros shorten the time needed to set up and operate the program.\nBorland released its first Quattro program to the public in 1987, after Borland\u2019s engineers had labored over its development for nearly three years. Borland\u2019s objective was to develop a spreadsheet program far superi- or to existing programs, including Lotus 1-2-3. In Borland\u2019s words, \u201c[flrom the time of its initial release ... Quattro included enormous innovations over competing spreadsheet products.\u201d\nThe district court found, and Borland does not now contest, that Borland included in its Quattro and Quattro Pro version 1.0 programs \u201ca virtually identical copy of the entire 1-2-3 menu tree.\u201d Borland III, 831 F.Supp. at 212 (emphasis in original). In so doing, Borland did not copy any of Lotus\u2019s underlying computer code; it copied only the words and structure of Lotus\u2019s menu command hierarchy. Borland included the Lotus menu command hierarchy in its programs to make them compatible with Lotus 1-2-3 so that spreadsheet users who were already familiar with Lotus 1-2-3 would be able to switch to the Borland programs without having to learn new commands or rewrite their Lotus macros.\nIn its Quattro and Quattro Pro version 1.0 programs, Borland achieved compatibility with Lotus 1-2-3 by offering its users an alternate user interface, the \u201cLotus Emulation Interface.\u201d By activating the Emulation Interface, Borland users would see the Lotus menu commands on their screens and could interact with Quattro or Quattro Pro as if using Lotus 1-2-3, albeit with a slightly different looking screen and with many Bor-land options not available on Lotus 1-2-3. In effect, Borland allowed users to choose how they wanted to communicate with Bor-land\u2019s spreadsheet programs: either by using menu commands designed by Borland, or by using the commands and command structure used in Lotus 1-2-3 augmented by Bor-land-added commands.\nLotus filed this action against Borland in the District of Massachusetts on July 2,1990, four days after a district court held that the Lotus 1-2-3 \u201cmenu structure, taken as a whole \u2014 including the choice of command terms [and] the structure and order of those terms,\u201d was protected expression covered by Lotus\u2019s copyrights. Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Paperback Software Int\u2019l, 740 F.Supp. 37, 68, 70 (D.Mass.1990) (\u201cPaperback\u201d).\n1\nThree days earlier, on the morning after the Paperback decision, Borland had filed a declaratory judgment action against Lotus in the Northern District of California, seeking a declaration of non-infringement. On September 10, 1990, the district court in California dismissed Borland\u2019s declaratory judgment action in favor of this action.\nLotus and Borland filed cross motions for summary judgment; the district court denied both motions on March 20, 1992, concluding that \u201cneither party\u2019s motion is supported by the record.\u201d Borland I, 788 F.Supp. at 80. The district court invited the parties to file renewed summary judgment motions that would \u201cfocus their arguments more precisely\u201d in light of rulings it had made in conjunction with its denial of their summary judgment motions. Id. at 82. Both parties filed renewed motions for summary judgment on April 24, 1992. In its motion, Borland contended that the Lotus 1-2-3 menus were not copyrightable as a matter of law and that no reasonable trier of fact could find that the similarity between its products and Lotus 1-2-3 was sufficient to sustain a determination of infringement. Lotus contended in its motion that Borland had copied Lotus 1-2-3\u2019s entire user interface and had thereby infringed Lotus\u2019s copyrights.\nOn July 31, 1992, the district court denied Borland\u2019s motion and granted Lotus\u2019s motion in part. The district court ruled that the Lotus menu command hierarchy was copyrightable expression because\n[a] very satisfactory spreadsheet menu tree can be constructed using different commands and a different command structure from those of Lotus 1-2-3. In fact, Borland has constructed just such an alternate tree for use in Quattro Pro\u2019s native mode. Even if one holds the arrangement of menu commands constant, it is possible to generate literally millions of satisfactory menu trees by varying the menu commands employed.\nBorland II, 799 F.Supp. at 217. The district court demonstrated this by offering alternate command words for the ten commands that appear in Lotus\u2019s main menu. Id. For example, the district court stated that \u201c[t]he \u2018Quit\u2019 command could be named \u2018Exit\u2019 without any other modifications,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he \u2018Copy' command could be called \u2018Clone,\u2019 \u2018Ditto,\u2019 \u2018Duplicate,\u2019 \u2018Imitate,\u2019 \u2018Mimic,\u2019 \u2018Replicate,\u2019 and \u2018Reproduce,\u2019 among others.\u201d Id. Because so many variations were possible, the district court concluded that the Lotus developers\u2019 choice and arrangement of command terms, reflected in the Lotus menu command hierarchy, constituted copyrightable expression.\nIn granting partial summary judgment to Lotus, the district court held that Borland had infringed Lotus\u2019s copyright in Lotus 1-2-8:\n[A]s a matter of law, Borland\u2019s Quattro products infringe the Lotus 1-2-3 copyright because of (1) the extent of copying of the \u201cmenu commands\u201d and \u201cmenu structure\u201d that is not genuinely disputed in this case, (2) the extent to which the copied elements of the \u201cmenu commands\u201d and \u201cmenu structure\u201d contain expressive aspects separable from the functions of the \u201cmenu commands\u201d and \u201cmenu structure,\u201d and (3) the scope of those copied expressive aspects as an integral part of Lotus 1-2-3.\nBorland II, 799 F.Supp. at 223 (emphasis in original). The court nevertheless concluded that while the Quattro and Quattro Pro programs infringed Lotus\u2019s copyright, Borland had not copied the entire Lotus 1-2-3 user interface, as Lotus had contended. Accordingly, the court concluded that a jury trial was necessary to determine the scope of Borland\u2019s infringement, including whether Borland copied the long prompts\n2\nof Lotus 1-2-3, whether the long prompts contained expressive elements, and to what extent, if any, functional constraints limited the number of possible ways that the Lotus menu command hierarchy could have been arranged at the time of its creation. See Borland III, 831 F.Supp. at 207. Additionally, the district court granted Lotus summary judgment on Borland\u2019s affirmative defense of waiver, but not on its affirmative defenses of laches and estoppel. Borland II, 799 F.Supp. at 222-23.\nImmediately following the district court\u2019s summary judgment decision, Borland removed the Lotus Emulation Interface from its products. Thereafter, Borland\u2019s spreadsheet programs no longer displayed the Lotus 1-2-3 menus to Borland users, and as a result Borland users could no longer communicate with Borland\u2019s programs as if they were using a more sophisticated version of Lotus 1-2-3. Nonetheless, Borland\u2019s programs continued to be partially compatible with Lotus 1-2-3, for Borland retained what it called the \u201cKey Reader\u201d in its Quattro Pro programs. Once turned on, the Key Reader allowed Borland\u2019s programs to understand and perform some Lotus 1-2-3 macros.\n3\nWith the Key Reader on, the Borland programs used Quattro Pro menus for display, interaction, and macro execution, except when they encountered a slash (\u201c/\u201d) key in a macro (the starting key for any Lotus 1-2-3 macro), in which case they interpreted the macro as having been written for Lotus 1-2-3. Accordingly, people who wrote or purchased macros to shorten the time needed to perform an operation in Lotus 1-2-3 could still use those macros in Borland\u2019s programs.\n4\nThe district court permitted Lotus to file a supplemental complaint alleging that the Key Reader infringed its copyright.\nThe parties agreed to try the remaining liability issues without a jury. The district court held two trials, the Phase I trial covering all remaining issues raised in the original complaint (relating to the Emulation Interface) and the Phase II trial covering all issues raised in the supplemental complaint (relating to the Key Reader). At the Phase I trial, there were no live witnesses, although considerable testimony was presented in the form of affidavits and deposition excerpts. The district court ruled upon evidentiary objections counsel interposed. At the Phase II trial, there were two live witnesses, each of whom demonstrated the programs for the district court.\nAfter the close of the Phase I trial, the district court permitted Borland to amend its answer to include the affirmative defense of \u201cfair use.\u201d Because Borland had presented all of the evidence supporting its fair-use defense dining the Phase I trial, but Lotus had not presented any evidence on fair use (as the defense had not been raised before the conclusion of the Phase I trial), the district court considered Lotus\u2019s motion for judgment on partial findings of fact. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(c). The district court held that Borland had failed to show that its use of the Lotus 1-2-3 menu command hierarchy in its Emulation Interface was a fair use. See Borland III, 831 F.Supp. at 208.\nIn its Phase I-trial decision, the district court found that \u201ceach of the Borland emulation interfaces contains a virtually identical copy of the 1-2-3 menu tree and that the 1-2-3 menu tree is capable of a wide variety of expression.\u201d Borland III, 831 F.Supp. at 218. The district court also rejected Bor-land\u2019s affirmative defenses of laches and es-toppel. Id. at 218-23.\nIn its Phase II-trial decision, the district court found that Borland\u2019s Key Reader file included \u201ca virtually identical copy of the Lotus menu tree structure, but represented in a different form and with first letters of menu command names in place of the full menu command names.\u201d Borland TV, 831 F.Supp. at 228. In other words, Borland\u2019s programs no longer included the Lotus command terms, but only their first letters. The district court held that \u201cthe Lotus menu structure, organization, and first letters of the command names ... constitute part of the protectable expression found in [Lotus 1-2-3].\u201d Id. at 233. Accordingly, the district court held that with its Key Reader, Borland had infringed Lotus\u2019s copyright. Id. at 245. The district court also rejected Borland\u2019s affirmative defenses of waiver, laches, estoppel, and fair use. Id. at 235-45. The district court then entered a permanent injunction against Borland, id. at 245, from which Borland appeals.\nThis appeal concerns only Borland\u2019s copying of the Lotus menu command hierarchy into its Quattro programs and Borland\u2019s affirmative defenses to such copying. Lotus has not cross-appealed; in other words, Lotus does not contend on appeal that the district court erred in finding that Borland had not copied other elements of Lotus 1-2-3, such as its screen displays.\nII.\nDiscussion\nOn appeal, Borland does not dispute that it factually copied the words and arrangement of the Lotus menu command hierarchy. Rather, Borland argues that it \u201clawfully copied the unprotectable menus of Lotus 1-2-3.\u201d Borland contends that the Lotus menu command hierarchy is not copyrightable because it is a system, method of operation, process, or procedure foreclosed from protection by 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b). Borland also raises a number of affirmative defenses.\nA Copyright Infringement Generally\nTo establish copyright infringement, a plaintiff must prove \u201c(1) ownership of a valid copyright, and (2) copying of constituent elements of the work that are original.\u201d Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., 499 U.S. 340, 361, 111 S.Ct. 1282, 1296, 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991); see also Data Gen. Corp. v. Grumman Sys. Support Corp., 36 F.3d 1147, 1160 n. 19 (1st Cir.1994); Concrete Mach. Co. v. Classic Lawn Ornaments, Inc., 843 F.2d 600, 605 (1st Cir.1988). To, show ownership of a valid copyright and therefore satisfy Feist\u2019s first prong, a plaintiff must prove that the work as a whole is original and that the plaintiff complied with applicable statutory formalities. See Engineering Dynamics, Inc. v. Structural Software, Inc., 26 F.3d 1335, 1340 (5th Cir.1994). \u201cIn judicial proceedings, a certificate of copyright registration constitutes prima facie evidence of copyrightability and shifts the burden to the defendant to demonstrate why the copyright is not valid.\u201d Bibbero Sys., Inc. v. Colwell Sys., Inc., 893 F.2d 1104, 1106 (9th Cir.1990); see also 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 410(c); Folio Impressions, Inc. v. Byer California, 937 F.2d 759, 763 (2d Cir.1991) (presumption of validity may be rebutted).\nTo show actionable copying and therefore satisfy Feist\u2019s second prong, a plaintiff must first prove that the alleged infringer copied plaintiffs copyrighted work as a factual matter; to do this, he or she may either present direct evidence of factual copying or, if that is unavailable, evidence that the alleged infringer had access to the copyrighted work and that the offending and copyrighted works are so similar that the court may infer that there was factual copying (i.e., probative similarity). Engineering Dynamics, 26 F.3d at 1340; see also Concrete Mach., 843 F.2d at 606. The plaintiff must then prove that the copying of copyrighted material was so extensive that it rendered the offending and copyrighted works substantially similar. See Engineering Dynamics, 26 F.3d at 1341.\nIn this appeal, we are faced only with whether the Lotus menu command hierarchy is copyrightable subject matter in the first instance, for Borland concedes that Lotus has a valid copyright in Lotus 1-2-3 as a whole\n5\nand admits to factually copying the Lotus menu command hierarchy. As a result, this appeal is in a very different posture from most copyright-infringement cases, for copyright infringement generally turns on whether the defendant has copied protected expression as a factual matter. Because of this different posture, most copyright-infringement cases provide only limited help to us in deciding this appeal. This is true even with respect to those copyright-infringement cases that deal with computers and computer software.\nB. Matter of First Impression\nWhether a computer menu command hierarchy constitutes copyrightable subject matter is a matter of first impression in this court. While some other courts appear to have touched on it briefly in dicta, see, e.g., Autoskill, Inc. v. National Educ. Support Sys., Inc., 994 F.2d 1476, 1495 n. 23 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S.-, 114 S.Ct. 307, 126 L.Ed.2d 254 (1993), we know of no cases that deal with the copyrightability of a menu command hierarchy standing on its own (i.e., without other elements of the user interface, such as screen displays, in issue). Thus we are navigating in uncharted waters.\nBorland vigorously argues, however, that the Supreme Court charted our course more than 100 years ago when it decided Baker v. Selden, 101 U.S. 99, 25 L.Ed. 841 (1879). In Baker v. Selden, the Court held that Selden\u2019s copyright over the textbook in which he explained his new way to do accounting did not grant him a monopoly on the use of his accounting system.\n6\nBorland argues:\nThe facts of Baker v. Selden, and even the arguments advanced by the parties in that case, are identical to those in this case. The only difference is that the \u201cuser interface\u201d of Selden\u2019s system was implemented by pen and paper rather than by computer.\nTo demonstrate that Baker v. Selden and this appeal both involve accounting systems, Borland even supplied this court with a video that, with special effects, shows Selden\u2019s paper forms \u201cmelting\u201d into a computer screen and transforming into Lotus 1-2-3.\nWe do not think that Baker v. Selden is nearly as analogous to this appeal as Borland claims. Of course, Lotus 1-2-3 is a computer spreadsheet, and as such its grid of horizontal rows and vertical columns certainly resembles an accounting ledger or any other paper spreadsheet. Those grids, however, are not at issue in this appeal for, unlike Selden, Lotus does not claim to have a monopoly over its accounting system. Rather, this appeal involves Lotus\u2019s monopoly over the commands it uses to operate the computer. Accordingly, this appeal is not, as Bor-land contends, \u201cidentical\u201d to Baker v. Selden.\nC. Altai\nBefore we analyze whether the Lotus menu command hierarchy is a system, method of operation, process, or procedure, we first consider the applicability of the test the Second Circuit set forth in Computer Assoc. Int'l, Inc. v. Altai, Inc., 982 F.2d 693 (2d Cir.1992).\n7\nThe Second Circuit designed its Altai test to deal with the fact that computer programs, copyrighted as \u201cliterary works,\u201d can be infringed by what is known as \u201cnonliteral\u201d copying, which is copying that is paraphrased or loosely paraphrased rather than word for word. See id. at 701 (citing nonliteral-copying cases); see also 3 Melville B. Nimmer & David Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright \u00a7 13.03[A][1] (1993). When faced with nonliteral-copying eases, courts must determine whether similarities are due merely to the fact that the two works share the same underlying idea or whether they instead indicate that the second author copied the first author\u2019s expression. The Second Circuit designed its Altai test to deal with this situation in the computer context, specifically with whether one computer program copied nonliteral expression from another program\u2019s code.\nThe Altai test involves three steps: abstraction, filtration, and comparison. The abstraction step requires courts to \u201cdissect the allegedly copied program\u2019s structure and isolate each level of abstraction contained within it.\u201d Altai, 982 F.2d at 707. This step enables courts to identify the appropriate framework within which to separate protect-able expression from unprotected ideas. Second, courts apply a \u201cfiltration\u201d step in which they examine \u201cthe structural components at each level of abstraction to determine whether their particular inclusion at that level was \u2018idea\u2019 or was dictated by considerations of efficiency, so as to be necessarily incidental to that idea; required by factors external to the program itself; or taken from the public domain.\u201d Id. Finally, courts compare the protected elements of the infringed work (i.e., those that survived the filtration screening) to the corresponding elements of the allegedly infringing work to determine whether there was sufficient copying of protected material to constitute infringement. Id. at 710.\nIn the instant appeal, we are not confronted with alleged nonliteral copying of computer code. Rather, we are faced with Borland\u2019s deliberate, literal copying of the Lotus menu command hierarchy. Thus, we must determine not whether nonliteral copying occurred in some amorphous sense, but rather whether the literal copying of the Lotus menu command hierarchy constitutes copyright infringement.\nWhile the Altai test may provide a useful framework for assessing the alleged nonliteral copying of computer code, we find it to be of little help in assessing whether the literal copying of a menu command hierarchy constitutes copyright infringement. In fact, we think that the Altai test in this context may actually be misleading because, in instructing courts to abstract the various levels, it seems to encourage them to find a base level that includes copyrightable subject matter that, if literally copied, would make the copier liable for copyright infringement.\n8\nWhile that base (or literal) level would not be at issue in a nonliteral-copying case like Altai, it is precisely what is at issue in this appeal. We think that abstracting menu command hierarchies down to their individual word and menu levels and then filtering idea from expression at that stage, as both the Altai and the district court tests require, obscures the more fundamental question of whether a menu command hierarchy can be copyrighted at all. The initial inquiry should not be whether individual components of a menu command hierarchy are expressive, but rather whether the menu command hierarchy as a whole can be copyrighted. But see Gates Rubber Co. v. Bando Chem. Indus., Ltd., 9 F.3d 823 (10th Cir.1993) (endorsing Altai\u2019s abstraction-filtration-comparison test as a way of determining whether \u201cmenus and sorting criteria\u201d are copyrightable).\nD. The Lotus Menu Command Hierarchy: A \u201cMethod of Operation\u201d\nBorland argues that the Lotus menu command hierarchy is uneopyrightable because it is a system, method of operation, process, or procedure foreclosed from copyright protection by 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b). Section 102(b) states: \u201cIn no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.\u201d Because we conclude that the Lotus menu command hierarchy is a method of operation, we do not consider whether it could also be a system, process, or procedure.\nWe think that \u201cmethod of operation,\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 102(b), refers to the means by which a person operates something, whether it be a car, a food processor, or a computer. Thus a text describing how to operate something would not extend copyright protection to the method of operation itself; other people would be free to employ that method and to describe it in their own words. Similarly, if a new method of operation is used rather than described, other people would still be free to employ or describe that method.\nWe hold that the Lotus menu command hierarchy is an uneopyrightable \u201cmethod of operation.\u201d The Lotus menu command hierarchy provides the means by which users control and operate Lotus 1-2-3. If users wish to copy material, for example, they use the \u201cCopy\u201d command. If users wish to print material, they use the \u201cPrint\u201d command. Users must use the command terms to tell the computer what to do. Without the menu command hierarchy, users would not be able to access and control, or indeed make use of, Lotus 1-2-3\u2019s functional capabilities.\nThe Lotus menu command hierarchy does not merely explain and present Lotus 1-2-3\u2019s functional capabilities to the user; it also serves as the method by which the program is operated and controlled. The Lotus menu command hierarchy is different from the Lotus long prompts, for the long prompts are not necessary to the operation of the program; users could operate Lotus 1-2-3 even if there were no long prompts.\n9\nThe Lotus menu command hierarchy is also different from the Lotus screen displays, for users need not \u201cuse\u201d any expressive aspects of the screen displays in order to operate Lotus 1-2-3; because the way the screens look has little bearing on how users control the program, the screen displays are not part of Lotus 1-2-3\u2019s \u201cmethod of operation.\u201d\n10\nThe Lotus menu command hierarchy is also different from the underlying computer code, because while code is necessary for the program to work, its precise formulation is not. In other words, to offer the same capabilities as Lotus 1-2-3, Borland did not have to copy Lotus\u2019s underlying code (and indeed it did not); to 'allow users to operate its programs in substantially the same way, however, Bor-land had to copy the Lotus menu command hierarchy. Thus the Lotus 1-2-3 code is not a uncopyrightable \u201cmethod of operation.\u201d\n11\nThe district court held that the Lotus menu command hierarchy, with its specific choice and arrangement of command terms, constituted an \u201cexpression\u201d of the \u201cidea\u201d of operating a computer program with commands arranged hierarchically into menus and submenus. Borland II, 799 F.Supp. at 216. Under the district court\u2019s reasoning, Lotus\u2019s decision to employ hierarchically arranged command terms to operate its program could not foreclose its competitors from also employing hierarchically arranged command terms to operate their programs, but it did foreclose them from employing the specific command terms and arrangement that Lotus had used. In effect, the district court limited Lotus 1-2-3\u2019s \u201cmethod of operation\u201d to an abstraction.\nAccepting the district court\u2019s finding that the Lotus developers made some expressive choices in choosing and arranging the Lotus command terms, we nonetheless hold that that expression is not copyrightable because it is part of Lotus 1-2-3\u2019s \u201cmethod of operation.\u201d We do not think that \u201cmethods of operation\u201d are limited to abstractions; rather, they are the means by which a user operates something. If specific words are essential to operating something, then they are part of a \u201cmethod of operation\u201d and, as such, are unprotectable. This is so whether they must be highlighted, typed in, or even spoken, as computer programs no doubt will soon be controlled by spoken words.\nThe fact that Lotus developers could have designed the Lotus menu command hierarchy differently is immaterial to the question of whether it is a \u201cmethod of operation.\u201d In other words, our initial inquiry is not whether the Lotus menu command hierarchy incorporates any expression.\n12\nRather, our initial inquiry is whether the Lotus menu command hierarchy is a \u201cmethod of operation.\u201d Concluding, as we do, that users operate Lotus 1-2-3 by using the Lotus menu command hierarchy, and that the entire Lotus menu command hierarchy is essential to operating Lotus 1-2-3, we do not inquire further whether that method of operation could have been designed differently. The \u201cexpressive\u201d choices of what to name the command terms and how to arrange them do not magically change the uncopyrightable menu command hierarchy into copyrightable subject matter.\nOur holding that \u201cmethods of operation\u201d are not limited to mere abstractions is bolstered by Baker v. Selden. In Baker, the Supreme Court explained that\nthe teachings of science and the rules and methods of useful art have their final end in application and use; and this application and use are what the public derive from the publication of a book which teaches them.... The description of the art in a book, though entitled to the benefit of copyright, lays no foundation for an exclusive claim to the art itself. The object of the one is explanation; the object of the other is use. The'former may be secured by copyright. The latter can only be secured, if it can be secured at all, by letters-patent.\nBaker v. Selden, 101 U.S. at 104-05. Lotus wrote its menu command hierarchy so that people could learn it and use it. Accordingly, it falls squarely within the prohibition on copyright protection established in Baker v. Selden and codified by Congress in \u00a7 102(b).\nIn many ways, the Lotus menu command hierarchy is like the buttons used to control, say, a video cassette recorder (\u201cVCR\u201d). A VCR is a machine that enables one to watch and record video tapes. Users operate VCRs by pressing a series of buttons that are typically labelled \u201cRecord, Play, Reverse, Fast Forward, Pause, Stop/Eject.\u201d That the buttons are arranged and labeled does not make them a \u201cliterary work,\u201d nor does it make them an \u201cexpression\u201d of the abstract \u201cmethod of operating\u201d a VCR via a set of labeled buttons. Instead, the buttons are themselves the \u201cmethod of operating\u201d the VCR.\nWhen a Lotus 1-2-3 user chooses a command, either by highlighting it on the screen or by typing its first letter, he or she effectively pushes a button. Highlighting the \u201cPrint\u201d command on the screen, or typing the letter \u201cP,\u201d is analogous to pressing a VCR button labeled \u201cPlay.\u201d\nJust as one could not operate a buttonless VCR, it would be impossible to operate Lotus 1-2-3 without employing its menu command hierarchy. Thus the Lotus command terms are not equivalent to the labels on the VCR\u2019s buttons, but are instead equivalent to the buttons themselves. Unlike the labels on a VCR\u2019s buttons, which merely make operating a VCR easier by indicating the buttons\u2019 functions, the Lotus menu commands are essential to operating Lotus 1-2-3. Without the menu commands, there would be no way to \u201cpush\u201d the Lotus buttons, as one could push unlabeled VCR buttons. While Lotus could probably have designed a user interface for which the command terms were mere labels, it did not do so here. Lotus 1-2-3 depends for its operation on use of the precise command terms that make up the Lotus.menu \u25a0 command hierarchy.\nOne might argue that the buttons for operating a VCR are not analogous to the commands for operating a computer program because VCRs are not copyrightable, whereas computer programs are. VCRs may not be copyrighted because they do not fit within any of the \u00a7 102(a) categories of copyrightable works; the closest they come is \u201csculptural work.\u201d Sculptural works, however, are subject to a \u201cuseful-article\u201d exception whereby \u201cthe design of a useful article ... shall be considered a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work only if, and only to the extent that, such design incorporates pictorial, graphic, or sculptural features that can be identified separately from, and are\" capable of existing independently of, the utilitarian aspects of the article.\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101. A \u201cuseful article\u201d is \u201can article having an intrinsic utilitarian function that is not merely to portray the appearance of the article or to convey information.\u201d Id. Whatever expression there may be in the arrangement of the parts of a VCR is not capable of existing separately from the VCR itself, so an ordinary VCR would not be copyrightable.\nComputer programs, unlike VCRs, are copyrightable as \u201cliterary works.\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(a). Accordingly, one might argue, the \u201cbuttons\u201d used to operate a computer program are not like the buttons used to operate a VCR, for they are not subject to a useful-article exception. The response, of course, is that the arrangement of buttons on a VCR would not be- copyrightable even without a useful-article exception, because the buttons are an uncopyrightable \u201cmethod of operation.\u201d Similarly, the \u201cbuttons\u201d of a computer program are also an uncopyrightable \u201cmethod of operation.\u201d\nThat the Lotus menu command hierarchy is a \u201cmethod of operation\u201d becomes clearer when one considers program compatibility. Under Lotus\u2019s theory, if a user uses several different programs, he or she must learn how to perform the same operation in a different way for each program used. For example, if the user wanted the computer to print material, then the user would have to learn not just one method of operating the computer such that it prints, but many different methods. We find this absurd. The fact that there may be many different ways to operate a computer program, or even many different ways to operate a computer program using a set of hierarchically arranged command terms, does not make the actual method of operation chosen copyrightable; it still functions as a method for operating the computer and as such is uncopyrightable.\nConsider also that users employ the Lotus menu command hierarchy in writing macros. Under the district court\u2019s holding, if the user wrote a macro to shorten the time needed to perform a certain operation in Lotus 1-2-3,, the user would be unable to use that macro to shorten the time needed to perform that same operation in another program. Rather, the user would have to rewrite his or her macro using that other program\u2019s menu command hierarchy. This is despite the fact that the macro is clearly the user\u2019s own work product. We think that forcing the user to cause the computer to perform the same operation in a different way ignores Congress\u2019s direction in \u00a7 102(b) that \u201cmethods of operation\u201d are not copyrightable. That programs can offer users the ability to write macros in many different ways does not change the fact that, once written,- the macro allows the user to perform an operation automatically. As the Lotus menu command hierarchy serves as the basis for Lotus 1-2-3 macros, the Lotus menu command hierarchy is a \u201cmethod of operation.\u201d\nIn holding that expression that is part of a \u201cmethod of operation\u201d cannot be copyrighted, we do not understand ourselves to go against the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in Feist In Feist, the Court explained:\nThe primary objective of copyright is not to reward the labor of authors, but to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts. To this end, copyright assures authors the right to their original expression, but encourages others to- build freely upon the ideas and information conveyed by a work.\nFeist, 499 U.S. at 349-50, 111 S.Ct. at 1290 (quotations and citations omitted). We do not think that the Court\u2019s statement that \u201ccopyright assures authors the right to their original expression\u201d indicates that all expression is necessarily copyrightable; while original expression is necessary for copyright protection, we do not think that it is alone sufficient. Courts must still inquire whether original expression falls within one of the categories foreclosed from copyright protection by \u00a7 102(b), such as being a \u201cmethod of operation.\u201d\nWe also note that in most contexts, there is no need to \u201cbuild\u201d upon other people\u2019s expression, for the ideas conveyed by that expression can be conveyed by someone else without copying the first author\u2019s expression.\n13\nIn the context of methods of operation, however, \u201cbuilding\u201d requires the use of the precise method of operation already employed; otherwise, \u201cbuilding\u201d would require dismantling, too. Original developers are not the only people entitled to build on the methods of operation they create; anyone can. Thus, Borland may build on the method of operation that Lotus designed and may use the Lotus menu command hierarchy in doing so.\nOur holding that methods of operation are not limited to abstractions goes against Autoskill, 994 F.2d at 1495 n. 23, in which the Tenth Circuit rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that the keying procedure used in a computer program was an uncopyrightable \u201cprocedure\u201d or \u201cmethod of operation\u201d under \u00a7 102(b). The program at issue, which was designed t\u00f3 test and train students with reading deficiencies, id. at 1481, required students to select responses to the program\u2019s queries \u201cby pressing the 1, 2, or 3 keys.\u201d Id. at 1495 n. 23. The Tenth Circuit held that, \u201cfor purposes of the preliminary injunction, ... the record showed that [this] keying procedure reflected at least a minimal degree of creativity,\u201d as required by Feist for copyright protection. Id. As an initial matter, we question whether a programmer\u2019s decision to have users select a response by pressing the 1,\u20192, or 3 keys is original. More importantly, however, we fail to see how \u201ca student selecting] a response by pressing the 1, 2, or 3 keys,\u201d id., can be anything but an unprotectable method of operation.\n14\nIII.\nConclusion\nBecause we hold that the Lotus menu command hierarchy is uneopyrightable subject matter, we further hold that Borland did not infringe Lotus\u2019s copyright by copying it. Accordingly, we need not consider any of Bor-land\u2019s affirmative defenses. The judgment of the district court is\nReversed.\nConcurrence follows.\n1 . Judge Keeton presided over both the Paperback litigation and this case.\n2 . Lotas 1-2-3 utilizes a two-line menu; the top line lists the commands from which the user may choose, and the bottom line displays what Lotus calls its \"long prompts.\u201d The long prompts explain, as a sort of \u201chelp text,\u201d what the highlighted menu command will do if entered. For example, the long prompt for the \"Worksheet\u201d command displays the submenu that the \"Worksheet\u201d command calls up; it reads \"Global, Insert, Delete, Column, Erase, Titles, Window, Status, Page.\" The long prompt for the \u201cCopy\u201d command explains what function the \u201cCopy\u201d command will perform; \u201cCopy a cell or range of cells.\u201d The long prompt for the \"Quit\" command reads, \u201cEnd 1-2-3 session (Have you saved your work?).\u201d\nPrior to trial, the parties agreed to exclude the copying of the long prompts from the case; Lotus agreed not to contend that Borland had copied the long prompts, Borland agreed not to argue that it had not copied the long prompts, and both sides agreed not to argue that the issue of whether Borland had copied the long prompts was material to any other issue in the case. See Borland III, 831 F.Supp. at 208.\n3 . Because Borland's programs could no longer display the Lotus menu command hierarchy to users, the Key Reader did not allow debugging or modification of macros, nor did it permit the execution of most interactive macros.\n4 . See Borland IV, 831 F.Supp. at 226-27, for a more detailed explanation of macros and the Key Reader.\n5 . Computer programs receive copyright protection as \u201cliterary works.\u201d See 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(a)(1) (granting protection to \u201cliterary works\u201d) and 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 (defining \"literary works\u201d as \"works ... expressed in words, numbers, or other verbal or numerical symbols or indicia, regardless of the nature of the material objects, such as books, periodicals, phonorecords, film, tapes, disks, or cards, in which they are embodied\" (emphasis added)); see also H.R.Rep. No. 1476, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 54 (1976), reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5667 (\"The term \u2018literary works' ... includes computer data bases, and computer programs to the extent that they incorporate authorship in the programmer\u2019s expression of original ideas, as distinguished from the ideas themselves.\u201d).\n6 . Selden's system of double-entry bookkeeping is the now almost-universal T-accounts system.\n7 . We consider the Altai test because both parties and many of the amici focus on it so heavily. Borland, in particular, is highly critical of the district court for not employing the Altai test. Borland does not, however, indicate how using that test would have been dispositive in Bor-land's favor. Interestingly, Borland appears to contradict its own reasoning at times by criticizing the applicability of the Altai test.\n8 . We recognize that Altai never states that every work contains a copyrightable \u201cnugget\" of pro-tectable expression. Nonetheless, the implication is that for literal copying, \"it is not necessary to determine the level of abstraction at which similarity ceases to consist of an 'expression of ideas,' because literal similarity by definition is always a similarity as to the expression of ideas.\u201d 3 Melville B. Nimmer & David Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright \u00a7 13.03[A](2) (1993).\n9 . As the Lotus long prompts are not before us on appeal, we take no position on their copyright-ability, although we do note that a strong argument could be made that the brief explanations they provide \"merge\u201d with the underlying idea of explaining such functions. See Morrissey v. Procter & Gamble Co., 379 F.2d 675, 678-79 (1st Cir.1967) (when the possible ways to express an idea are limited, the expression \"merges\u201d with the idea and is therefore uncopyrightable; when merger occurs, identical copying is permitted).\n10 .As they are not before us on appeal, we take no position on whether the Lotus 1-2-3 screen displays constitute original expression capable of being copyrighted.\n11 . Because the Lotus 1-2-3 code is not before us on appeal, we take no position on whether it is copyrightable. We note, however, that original computer codes generally are protected by copyright. See, e.g., Altai, 982 F.2d at 702 (\"It is now well settled that the literal elements of computer programs, i.e., their source and object codes, are the subject of copyright protection.\u201d) (citing cases).\n12 . We think that the Altai test would contemplate this being the initial inquiry.\n13 . When there are a limited number of ways to express an idea, however, the expression \u201cmerges\u201d with the idea and becomes uncopyrightable. Morrissey, 379 F.2d at 678-79.\n14 . The Ninth Circuit has also indicated in dicta that \"menus, and keystrokes\u201d may be copyrightable. Brown Bag Software v. Symantec Corp., 960 F.2d 1465, 1477 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, BB Asset Management, Inc. v. Symantec Corp., \u2014 U.S. -, 113 S.Ct. 198, 121 L.Ed.2d 141 (1992). In that case, however, the plaintiff did not show that the defendant had copied the plaintiffs menus or keystrokes, so the court was not directly faced with whether the menus or keystrokes constituted an unprotectable method of operation. Id.", "author": "STAHL, Circuit Judge."}, {"type": "concurrence", "text": "BOUDIN, Circuit Judge,\nconcurring.\nThe importance of this ease, and a slightly different emphasis in my view of the underlying problem, prompt me to add a few words to the majority\u2019s tightly focused discussion.\nI.\nMost of the law of copyright and the \u201ctools\u201d of analysis have developed in the context of literary works such as novels, plays, and films. In this milieu, the principal problem \u2014 simply stated, if difficult to resolve \u2014 is to stimulate creative expression without unduly limiting access by others to the broader themes and concepts deployed by the author. The middle of the spectrum presents close cases; but a \u201cmistake\u201d in providing too much protection involves a small cost: subsequent authors treating the same themes must take a few more steps away from the original expression.\nThe problem presented by computer programs is fundamentally different in one re-speet. The computer program is a means for causing something to happen; it has a mechanical utility, an instrumental role, in accomplishing the world\u2019s work. Granting protection, in other words, can have some of the consequences of patent protection in limiting other people\u2019s ability to perform a task in the most efficient manner. Utility does not bar copyright (dictionaries may be copyrighted), but it alters the calculus.\nOf course, the argument for protection is undiminished, perhaps even enhanced, by utility: if we want more of an intellectual product, a temporary monopoly for the creator provides incentives for others to create other, different items in this class. But the \u201ccost\u201d side of the equation may be different where one places a very high value on public access to a useful innovation that may be the most efficient means of performing a given task. Thus, the argument for extending protection may be the same; but the stakes on the other side are much higher.\nIt is no accident that patent protection has preconditions that copyright protection does not \u2014 notably, the requirements of novelty and non-obviousness \u2014 and that patents are granted for a shorter period than copyrights. This problem of utility has sometimes manifested itself in copyright cases, such as Baker v. Selden, 101 U.S. 99, 25 L.Ed. 841 (1879), and been dealt with through various formulations that limit copyright or create limited rights to copy. But the case law and doctrine addressed to utility in copyright have been brief detours in the general march of copyright law.\nRequests for the protection of computer menus present the concern with fencing off access to the commons in an acute form. A new menu may be a creative work, but over time its importance may come to reside more in the investment that has been made by users in learning the menu and in building their own mini-programs \u2014 macros\u2014in reliance upon the menu. Better typewriter keyboard layouts may exist, but the familiar QWERTY keyboard dominates the market because that is what everyone has learned to use. See P. David, CLIO and the Economics of QWERTY, 75 Am.Econ.Rev. 332 (1985). The QWERTY keyboard is nothing other than a menu of letters.\nThus, to assume that computer programs are just one more new means of expression, like a filmed play, may be quite wrong. The \u201cform\u201d \u2014 the written source code or the menu structure depicted on the screen \u2014 look hauntingly like the familiar stuff of copyright; but the \u201csubstance\u201d probably has more to do with problems presented in patent law or, as already noted, in those rare cases where copyright law has confronted industrially useful expressions. Applying copyright law to computer programs is like assembling a jigsaw puzzle whose pieces do not quite fit.\nAll of this would make no difference if Congress had squarely confronted the issue, and given explicit directions as to what should be done. The Copyright Act of 1976 took a different course. While Congress said that computer programs might be subject to copyright protection, it said this in very general terms; and, especially in \u00a7 102(b), Congress adopted a string of exclusions that if taken literally might easily seem to exclude most computer programs from protection. The only detailed prescriptions for computers involve narrow issues (like back-up copies) of no relevance here.\nOf course, one could still read the statute as a congressional command that the familiar doctrines of copyright law be taken and applied to computer programs, in cookie cutter fashion, as if the programs were novels or play scripts. Some of the eases involving computer programs embody this approach. It seems to be mistaken on two different grounds: the tradition of copyright law, and the likely intent of Congress.\nThe broad-brush conception of copyright protection, the time limits, and the formalities have long been prescribed by statute. But the heart of copyright doctrine \u2014 what may be protected and with what limitations and exceptions \u2014 has been developed by the courts through experience with individual cases. B. Kaplan, An Unhurried View of Copyright 40 (1967). Occasionally Congress addresses a problem in detail. For the most part the interstitial development of copyright through the courts is our tradition.\nNothing in the language or legislative history of the 1976 Act, or at least nothing brought to our attention, suggests that Congress meant the courts to abandon this case-by-case approach. Indeed, by setting up \u00a7 102(b) as a counterpoint theme, Congress has arguably recognized the tension and left it for the courts to resolve through the development of ease law. And case law development is adaptive: it allows new problems to be solved with help of earlier doctrine, but it does not preclude new doctrines to meet new situations.\nII.\nIn this case, the raw facts are mostly, if not entirely, undisputed. Although the inferences to be drawn may be more debatable, it is very hard to see that Borland has shown any interest in the Lotus menu except as a fall-back option for those users already committed to it. by prior experience or in order to run their own macros using 1-2-3 commands. At least for the amateur, accessing the Lotus menu in the Borland Quattro or Quattro Pro program takes some effort.\nPut differently, it is unlikely that users who value the Lotus menu for its own sake\u2014 independent of any investment they have made themselves in learning Lotus\u2019 commands or creating macros dependent upon them \u2014 would choose the Borland program in order to secure access to the Lotus menu. Borland\u2019s success is due primarily to other features. Its rationale for deploying the Lotus menu bears the ring of truth.\nNow, any use of the Lotus menu by Bor-land is a commercial use and deprives Lotus of a portion of its \u201creward,\u201d in the sense that an infringement claim if allowed would increase Lotus\u2019 profits. But this is circular reasoning: broadly speaking, every limitation on copyright or privileged use diminishes the reward of the original creator. Yet not every writing is copyrightable or every use an infringement. The provision of reward is one concern of copyright law, but it is not the only one. If it were, copyrights would be perpetual and there would be no exceptions.\nThe present case is an unattractive one for copyright protection of the menu. The menu, commands (e.g., \u201cprint,\u201d \u201cquit\u201d) are largely for standard procedures that Lotus did not invent and are common words that Lotus cannot monopolize. What is left is the particular combination and sub-grouping of commands in a pattern devised by Lotus. This arrangement may have a more appealing logic and ease of use than some other configurations; but there is a certain arbitrariness to many of the choices.\nIf Lotus is granted a monopoly on this pattern, users who have learned the command structure of Lotus 1-2-3 or devised their own macros are locked into Lotus, just as a typist who has learned the QWERTY keyboard would be the captive of anyone who had a monopoly on the production of such a keyboard. Apparently, for a period Lotus 1-2-3 has had such sway in the market that it has represented the de facto standard for electronic spreadsheet commands. So long as Lotus is the superior spreadsheet \u2014 either in quality or in price \u2014 there may be nothing wrong with this advantage.\nBut if a better spreadsheet comes along, it is hard to see why customers who have learned the Lotus menu and devised macros for it should remain captives of Lotus because of an investment in learning made by the users and not by Lotus. Lotus has already reaped a substantial reward for being first; assuming that the Borland program is now better, good reasons exist for freeing it to attract old Lotus customers: to enable the old customers to take advantage of a new advance, and to reward Borland in turn for making a better product. If Bor-land has not made a better product, then customers will remain with Lotus anyway.\nThus, for me the question is not whether Borland should prevail but on what basis. Various avenues might be traveled, but the main choices are between holding that the menu is not protectable by copyright and devising a new doctrine that Borland\u2019s use is privileged. No solution is perfect and no intermediate appellate court can make the final choice.\nTo call the menu a \u201cmethod of operation\u201d is, in the common use of those words, a defensible position. After all, the purpose of the menu is not to be admired as a work of literary or pictorial art. It is to transmit directions from the user to the computer, i.e., to operate the computer. The menu is also a \u201cmethod\u201d in the dictionary sense because it is a \u201cplanned way of doing something,\u201d an \u201corder or system,\u201d and (aptly here) an \u201corderly or systematic arrangement, sequence or the like.\u201d Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary 853 (1991).\nA different approach would be to say that Borland\u2019s use is privileged because, in the context already described, it is not seeking to appropriate the advances made by Lotus\u2019 menu; rather, having provided an arguably more attractive menu of its own, Borland is merely trying to give former Lotus users an option to exploit their own prior investment in learning or in macros. The difference is that such a privileged use approach would not automatically protect Borland if it had simply copied the Lotus menu (using different codes), contributed nothing of its own, and resold Lotus under the Borland label.\nThe closest analogue in conventional copyright is the fair use doctrine. E.g., Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters., 471 U.S. 539, 105 S.Ct. 2218, 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985). Although invoked by Borland, it has largely been brushed aside in this case because the Supreme Court has said that it is \u201cpresumptively\u201d unavailable where the use is a \u201ccommercial\u201d one. See id. at 562, 105 S.Ct. at 2231-32. But see Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., \u2014 U.S. -, -, 114 S.Ct. 1164, 1174; 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994). In my view, this is something less than a definitive answer; \u201cpresumptively\u201d does not mean \u201calways\u201d and, in any event, the doctrine of fair use was created by the courts and can- be adapted to new purposes.\nBut a privileged use doctrine would certainly involve problems of its own. It might more closely tailor the limits on copyright protection to the reasons for limiting that protection; but it would entail a host of administrative problems that would cause cost and delay, and would also reduce the ability of the industry to predict outcomes. Indeed, to the extent that Lotus\u2019 menu is an important standard in the industry, it might be argued that any use ought to be deemed privileged.\nIn sum, the majority\u2019s result persuades me and its formulation is as good, if not better, than any other that occurs to me now as within the reach of courts. Some solutions {e.g., a very short copyright period for menus) are not options at all for courts but might be for Congress. In all events, the choices are important ones of policy, not linguistics, and they should be made with the underlying considerations in view.", "author": "BOUDIN, Circuit Judge,"}], "attorneys": ["Gary L.
