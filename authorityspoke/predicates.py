class Predicate:
    r"""
    A statement about real events or about a legal conclusion.

    Predicates may be "alleged" by a pleading, "supported" by evidence, or
    "found" to be factual by a jury verdict or a judge's finding of fact.

    :param content:
        a clause containing an assertion, with blanks represented
        by curly brackets showing where references to specific
        entities from the case can be inserted to make the clause specific.

    :param truth:
        indicates whether the clause in ``content`` is asserted to be
        true or false. ``None`` indicates an assertion as to "whether"
        the clause is true or false, without specifying which.

    :param reciprocal:
        if True, then the order of the first two entities
        is considered interchangeable. There's no way to make any entities
        interchangeable other than the first two.

    :param comparison:
        A string representing an equality or inequality sign like ``==``,
        ``>``, or ``<=``. Used to indicate that the clause ends with a
        comparison to some quantity. Should be defined if and only if a
        ``quantity`` is defined. Even though "=" is the default, it's
        the least useful, because courts almost always state rules that
        are intended to apply to quantities above or below some threshold.

    :param quantity:
        a Python number object or :class:`ureg.Quantity` from the
        `pint <https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/0.9/>`_ library. Comparisons to
        quantities can be used to determine whether :class:`Predicate`\s
        imply or contradict each other. A single :class:`Predicate`
        may contain no more than one ``comparison`` and one ``quantity``.
