    "This tutorial will show how to load objects representing judicial holdings into AuthoritySpoke. First we'll see how to create an instance of the Holding class using Python commands in a Python shell or notebook. Then we'll create a second holding in a separate text file in the YAML format, and we'll load that YAML file into AuthoritySpoke. We'll see that when AuthoritySpoke loads holdings from YAML, those holdings can be written in a more succinct format with more abbreviations. Then we'll demonstrate that the two Holdings we created can be used together even though they were created with different techniques.\n",

Mazza-Alaluf, [621 F.3d 205](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/175697/united-states-v-mazza-alaluf/) This is a 2010 case from the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. It describes how a violation of a state's licensing requirement for money transmitting businesses can result in a felony conviction under federal law.\n",

To download full cases from CAP, you'll need to [register for a CAP API key](https://case.law/user/register/). Once you have an API key, you can make it available as an environment variable by saving it as a file called `.env`.
