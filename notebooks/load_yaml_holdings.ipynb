    "This tutorial will show how to load objects representing judicial holdings into AuthoritySpoke. First we'll see how to create an instance of the Holding class using Python commands in a Python shell or notebook. Then we'll create a second holding in a separate text file in the YAML format, and we'll load that YAML file into AuthoritySpoke. We'll see that when AuthoritySpoke loads holdings from YAML, those holdings can be written in a more succinct format with more abbreviations. Then we'll demonstrate that the two Holdings we created can be used together even though they were created with different techniques.\n",

    "The case we'll be using for this demonstration is United States v. Mazza-Alaluf, [621 F.3d 205](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/175697/united-states-v-mazza-alaluf/) This is a 2010 case from the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. It describes how a violation of a state's licensing requirement for money transmitting businesses can result in a felony conviction under federal law.\n",

To download full cases from CAP, you'll need to [register for a CAP API key](https://case.law/user/register/). Once you have an API key, you can make it available as an environment variable by saving it as a file called `.env`.
