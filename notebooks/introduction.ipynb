    "The first obvious contrast between `lotus.holdings[6]` and `oracle.holdings[10]` is that the `Holding` from the _Lotus_ case is relatively succinct and categorical. The _Lotus_ court interprets Section 102(b) of the Copyright Act to mean that if a work is a \"method of operation\", it's simply impossible for that work to be copyrighted, so it's not necessary to consider a lot of case-specific facts to reach a conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Federal Circuit's _Oracle_ decision complicates that view significantly. The Federal Circuit believes that the fact that an API is, or hypothetically might be, a \"method of operation\" is only one of many factors that a court can consider in deciding copyrightability. The following quotation, repeated in the _Oracle_ case, illustrates the Federal Circuit's view.\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Section 102(b) does not extinguish the protection accorded a particular expression of an idea merely because that expression is embodied in a method of operation.” _Mitel, Inc. v. Iqtel, Inc._, 124 F.3d 1366, 1372 (10th Cir.1997)\n",
    "\n",
    "And that's why AuthoritySpoke finds a contradiction between these two `Rule`s. The _Oracle_ opinion says that courts can sometimes accept the result `the Fact that <the Java API> was copyrightable` despite the `Fact` `<the Java API> was a method of operation`. The _Lotus_ Opinion would consider that impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the way, AuthoritySpoke isn't applying any sophisticated grammatical parsing to understand the meaning of each Fact. AuthoritySpoke mostly won't recognize that `Fact`s have the same meaning unless their `content` values are exactly the same string. As discussed above, they can also differ in their references to generic factors, which are the phrases that appear in brackets when you use the `print()` command on them. And AuthoritySpoke can also compare `Fact`s based on an optional numeric value that can come at the end of their content, but that feature isn't demonstrated in this tutorial."

    "Let's look at one more sentence from the _Oracle_ `Opinion`, so I can point out a few more design decisions AuthoritySpoke makes in representing procedural `Holding`s.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In the Ninth Circuit, while questions regarding originality are considered questions of copyrightability, concepts of merger and scenes a faire are affirmative defenses to claims of infringement.\n",
    "\n",
    "(The \"merger\" doctrine says that a work is deemed to be \"merged\" with an uncopyrightable idea if it's essentially the only way to express the idea. \"Scenes a faire\" is a concept applied mostly to works of fiction, and it means that conventional genre tropes are not copyrightable.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The quoted sentence is fairly ordinary, as court opinions go, but I found several interesting challenges in creating structered data about its procedural meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The sentence describes what the law is \"In the Ninth Circuit\". You might remember that the court that issued the _Oracle_ opinion was the Federal Circuit, not the Ninth Circuit. So the Federal Circuit is deciding what it thinks that the Ninth Circuit thinks that Congress meant by enacting the statute. The middle layer of this interpretation, in which the Federal Circuit attributes a belief to the Ninth Circuit, is simply absent from the AuthoritySpoke model of the `Holding`. However, future updates to AuthoritySpoke might make it possible to capture this information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The sentence uses the concept of an \"affirmative defense\", which generally means a defense that the defendant has the burden of proof to establish. I chose to model this concept by writing that if one of the facts that would establish the affirmative defense is present, then it could be established that the copyright was not infringed, but if they are both absent, then the copyright could have been infringed. I'm sure some legal experts would find this too simplistic, and would argue that it's not possible to formalize the concept of an affirmative defense without explicitly mentioning procedural concepts like a burden of proof.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The sentence seems to have something to say about what happens if either of two Factors are present, or if both of them are absent. That makes three different Rules. It's not ideal for one sentence to explode into multiple different Python objects when it's formalized, and it's worth wondering whether there would have been a way to pack all the information into a single object. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. I noticed that the concept of a copyrighted work being \"merged\" or being a \"scene a faire\" are both characteristics intrinsic in the copyrighted work, and don't depend on the characteristics of the allegedly infringing work. So if a work that's \"merged\" or is a \"scene a faire\" can't be infringed, but those concepts aren't relevant to copyrightability, then that means there are some works that are \"copyrightable\" but that can never be infringed by any other work. I suspect that the court's interpretation of these legal categories could confuse future courts and parties, with the result that the \"merger\" or \"scene a faire\" concepts could fall through the cracks and be ignored. Would there be a useful way to have AuthoritySpoke flag such anomalies?\n",

    "> On appeal, Oracle argues that the district court’s reliance on Lotus is misplaced because it is distinguishable on its facts and is inconsistent with Ninth Circuit law. We agree. First, while the defendant in Lotus did not copy any of the underlying code, Google concedes that it copied portions of Oracle’s declaring source code verbatim. Second, the Lotus court found that the commands at issue there (copy, print, etc.) were not creative, but it is undisputed here that the declaring code and the structure and organization of the API packages are both creative and original. Finally, while the court in Lotus found the commands at issue were “essential to operating” the system, it is undisputed that— other than perhaps as to the three core packages — Google did not need to copy the structure, sequence, and organization of the Java API packages to write programs in the Java language.\\nMore importantly, however, the Ninth Circuit has not adopted the court’s “method of operation” reasoning in Lotus, and we conclude that it is inconsistent with binding precedent."
