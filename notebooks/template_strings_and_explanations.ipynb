    "The AuthoritySpoke library provides you with Python classes that you can use to represent a limited subset of English statements, so you can create smart annotations representing aspects of legal reasoning and factfinding. The interface for creating these phrases is similar to [Predicate logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Predicate_logic): it includes a Predicate, which is like a partial sentence with blank spaces marked by placeholders. The placeholders can be replaced by nouns that become the subjects or objects of this potential sentence. \n",

    "I chose to implement this feature with [template strings](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#string.Template) instead of Python's more powerful methods for inserting data into text strings, such as f-strings or the `.format()` method. The reason was that template strings' relative lack of versatility makes them more predictable and less bug-prone. Template strings don't execute any code when they run, so they present less of a security problem and they can be used with untrusted user-generated data."

The second placeholder, `child`, is preceded by a dollar sign and an open curly bracket, and followed by a closed curly bracket. These formats aren't specific to AuthoritySpoke; they're part of the Python standard library. The difference is that the format with just the dollar sign can only be used for a placeholder that is surrounded by whitespace. If the placeholder is next to some other character, like an apostrophe, then you need to use the \"braced\" format with the curly brackets. The placeholders themselves need to be valid Python identifiers, which means they can only be made up of letters, numbers, and underscores, and they can't start with a number. Docassemble users might already be familiar with these rules, since Docassemble variables also have to be Python identifiers. Check out Docassemble's documentation for more [guidance on creating valid Python identifiers](https://docassemble.org/docs/fields.html#variable%20names)."
