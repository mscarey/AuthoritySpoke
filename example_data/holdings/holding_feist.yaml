  - There is no doubt that Feist took from the white pages of Rural’s directory a

    towns, and telephone numbers of 1,309 of Rural’s subscribers.
- name: false Rural's arragement of its telephone listings was an original work
  anchors: 'The end product is a garden-variety white pages directory, devoid of even
    the slightest trace of creativity.

    Rural’s selection of listings could not be more obvious: It publishes the most
    basic information — name, town, and telephone number — about each person who applies
    to it for telephone service. This is “selection” of a sort, but it lacks the modicum
    of creativity necessary to transform mere selection into copyrightable expression.'

    the raw data does not satisfy the originality requirement.
